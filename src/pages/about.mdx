NaviNet is a web portal created for those who love the old net but also for those who hate the new web and want to take back the internet and return to the good old times.

<br />

# Ads

NaviNet doesn't contain malware & paid services. We do have some ads but they are
not intrusive and we do not get money from them, they are used as a form to share
other's people work from NeoCities.
