<h1>The open source web portal</h1>

NaviNet is a web portal created for those who love the old net but also for those who hate the new web and want to take back the internet and return to the good old times.

<br />

<h1>Privacy</h1>

NaviNet doesn't contain malware, paid services and we do not sell user data. The ads run on NaviNet are just a way to promote content from other people and we do not get money from them.

To learn more about how we handle data please check [our privacy policy](/about/privacy).
