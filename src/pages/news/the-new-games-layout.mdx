After the launch of NaviNet Games we received some feedback which was very positive but there was some issues specially with the layout.

This post will talk about the new changes and also more info about the games service and how you can help improve it.

<br />

# The new layout

So after the launch of version 1.0 and the games service some users noticed that the layout was kinda weird now version 1.0 was kinda rushed and we did a huge design change but for some reason Astro broke some stuff with the layout because the layout used on the compiled version was not the one we actually made but that was fixed and the design was also improved.

<br />

# New additions

The games layout it's now responsive and includes more info about the game like:

- Game image card
- Game specific category
- Game name

This new layout was also changed to the other game pages like the categories page.

With the version 1.1 we did some impovements to lists elements which are also visible on the games page.

<br />

# You can help!

Some users also asked on how to suggest/add new games and fortunately it isn't hard although we recommend you to wait since in a near feature there will be a forms which you can suggest new games.

<br />

If you are adventurous you can go to the [source code repo on our GitHub](https://github.com/navinet-open/web), go to the /public/swf and add your game (in .swf format) then go to the /src/pages/games/ and copy one of the existing .mdx files and change their metadata and embed tag data of the game you added and then open a PR which will then be checked manually to see if it checks out.

<br />

# The end

This is the end of the new changes. See you again and thanks for using NaviNet!
