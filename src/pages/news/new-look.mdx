After almost 1 week of trying to make a design that was good and also responsive we are happy to announce that we finally have settled in with this new kinda neon design that also works with mobile but that's not all, we've also removed half of unused CSS code making the website faster and smaller, fixed a lot of issues with our search service and best of all **our new service called NaviNet Games**!

<br />

# NaviNet Games

On the final test builds we had the idea to release a games service similar to Newgrounds and Miniclip with the purpose of nostalgia and to achive this we would host flash games but there's a big issues... flash is dead but we've found a framework capable of doing this making this idea come true!

At the moment is still in testing but it's public so you can try it **right now**!.

<br />

# NaviNet News

Another big announcement is the launch of our news service where we (NaviNet developers) upload announcements and small updates so you can stay updated.

<br />

# Accessibility

This new release had a lot of improvements over the test builds and one of them is accessibility. Colors are better in the eyes but also bright to enable them to be visible this also means NaviNet passes WAI!

<br />

# The End

So this is all the new stuff of version 1.0. Obviously there's other changes but their are not major to be included. See you again and thanks for using NaviNet!
